==============================
Account Analytic Account State
==============================

By installing this module, it will introduce a state workflow for the analytic accounts.

The states introduced by this module are:
#. Draft: It's the starting state of an analytic account;
#. Waiting For Approval: The analytic account was submitted by the user. It can be approved or refused by a manager or reset back to draft;
#. Approved: The analytic account was approved by a manager. It can still be reset to draft;
#. Declined: The analytic account was refused by a manager. It can be reset to draft;
#. Expired: The analytic account ran into its end. It can be resubmitted in order to extend its duration;
#. Cancelled: The analytic account was cancelled. It's still possible to reset it to draft;

All the transitions between the states can be manually triggered by users with the right permissions.

N.B.: To properly work, this module needs to install the module account_analytic_account_accessibility which can also be found in this repository.
