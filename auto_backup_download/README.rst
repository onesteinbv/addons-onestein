=============================
Database Auto-Backup Download
=============================

View and download the files of backup of the databases
contained in the directory on the server generated by the Database Auto-Backup module.

This module is meant to be a connection point between the two modules:

* The OCA module "Database Auto-Backup" (auto_backup)
* The Onestein module "Directory Files Download" (base_directory_file_download)

What the module does is to create a menu shortcut in the settings menu
(Settings -> Downloads -> Backups). The server directory displayed is the one
configured in configuration settings of the module "Database Auto-Backup".
If multiple configurations are present for "Database Auto-Backup", then
the shortcut will only refer to the first one.

Since the user will be able to download the backup files
directly from the Odoo interface, be aware that in case Odoo
is not working (for any reason), the user will not be able to download the backups!


Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

#. Configure the auto_backup feature, it should be working properly
#. Set the group "Download database backups" for the users who need this functionality.


Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

#. Go to Settings -> Downloads -> Backups
#. A list of backup files is displayed
#. Download the file you need
#. In case the content of the directory is modified, refresh the list by clicking the button on the top-right of the form
