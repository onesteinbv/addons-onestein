===================
Holidays expiration
===================

This module adds the possibility to manage the expiration of the holidays including
the possibility to send a customizable warning email to the HR responsible.

In a multi-company environment, the expiry is set at the allocation request. Then you can combine all holidays into one holiday leave type regardless of what is the current Company (this is the standard behavior of Odoo). This allows the end users to just have to select one type of holiday and the HR officer/manager can set their different expiry types (eg.: statutory / non - statutory) per allocation.

The holiday allocations are consumed by the first expiration type first.
