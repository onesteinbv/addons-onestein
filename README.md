Onestein - Odoo addons
======================

Odoo modules developed by Onestein B.V.

This repository hosts Onestein modules that do not fit in any OCA
(Odoo Community Association) repository due to their specificity or
because they can not be integrated yet.

You can find lots of modules developed by us in the OCA repositories,
together with a lot of other modules developed by the rest of the
community. Check the list here: https://github.com/OCA.
